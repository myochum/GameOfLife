# GameOfLife

Application developed for Software Design Spring 2015.
Worked with two students to begin developing a board game application for Android

Simple 2-4 player board game where players choose their own avatars and names. 
Players take turn rolling a dice and move around the board.
Each space has an event where the player will lose money, gain money, or teleport to another island space.


Mini game implementation to be added.
